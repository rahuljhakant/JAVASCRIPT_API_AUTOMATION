# Advanced Techniques Tutorials

## Overview

This directory covers advanced security testing techniques including advanced exploitation, privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, and evasion techniques.

## Tutorials

### 1. Advanced Exploitation
**File:** `advanced-exploitation.mjs`

Complex exploitation scenarios including command injection, XXE, SSRF, and insecure deserialization.

### 2. Privilege Escalation
**File:** `privilege-escalation.mjs`

Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, IDOR testing, and parameter pollution.

### 3. Persistence Mechanisms
**File:** `03_persistence.mjs`

Scheduled tasks, service installation, registry modifications, startup scripts, web shells, and backdoors.

### 4. Evasion Techniques
**File:** `04_evasion.mjs`

Signature evasion, behavioral evasion, encoding techniques, polymorphism, and anti-forensics.

## ⚠️ Legal and Ethical Guidelines

- Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Never implement persistence mechanisms on unauthorized systems
- Use evasion techniques only for authorized security testing
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
